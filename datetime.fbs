namespace Anise.Time;

// An epoch represents a date and time past the reference defined by the time system (defined for the full file).
// In ANISE, an epoch is represented as the number of seconds past the reference epoch.
// ANISE libraries **MUST** provide helper functions to convert dates between the language's native datetime representation (or a relevant structure if not available) into a double-double representation for the requested time system.
// It is stored as a double-double. A double-double number is an unevaluated sum of two IEEE double precision numbers, capable of representing at least 106 bits of significand.

// GPS: Global Positioning System
// SCLK: Spacecraft clock -- if used, then an ICD describing the clock model of the spacecraft must be provided
