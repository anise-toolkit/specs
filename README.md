# Specifications

## Project purpose
ANISE provides an open-source and open-governed library and algorithmic specification for most computations for astrodynamics. It is heavily inspired by NAIF SPICE, and may be considered as an open-source modern rewrite of SPICE.

ANISE is an acronym for Attitude, Navigation, Instrument, Spacecraft, and Ephemeris.

The toolkit provides a new file definition to store references frames, their related ephemeris and attitude trajectory, and respective covariances. The toolkit also provides algorithms for the most basic querying and astrodynamics calculations similar to SPICE, and their implementations in a number of languages (Rust, Python).

This toolkit is licensed in the Mozilla Public License 2.0, whose terms you may read [here](./LICENSE).

## ANIS file
