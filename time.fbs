/*
 * An epoch represents a date and time past the reference defined by the time system (defined for the full file).
 * In ANISE, an epoch is represented as the number of seconds past the reference epoch.
 * ANISE libraries **MUST** provide helper functions to convert dates between the language's native datetime representation (or a relevant structure if not available) into a double-double representation for the requested time system.
 * It is stored as a double-double. A double-double number is an unevaluated sum of two IEEE double precision numbers, capable of representing at least 106 bits of significand.
 * Description: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quadruple-precision_floating-point_format&oldid=1040957342#Double-double_arithmetic.
 *
 * NOTE: Because Epoch is a structure, it may not contain a flatbuffer enum. Therefore, the time system used must be specified along with the reference epoch.
