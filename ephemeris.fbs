 * UnequalTimeSteps defines an interpolated trajectory where each spline has its own duration.
 * This is common for spacecraft trajectories as the dynamics may vary greatly throughout the mission.
 * For example, an Earth orbiter's trajectory needs smaller splines to interpolate its Cartesian position over 1h30min
 * than a spacecraft in deep space between Jupiter and Saturn.
 *
 * This structure provides a pre-sorted index of time offsets enabling an implementor to perform a binary search
 * for the desired coefficients. Hence, UnequalTimeSteps provides O(log(n)) access to any state data.
 *
 * # Primer on building an interpolated trajectory
 * 1. Determine the interpolation scheme, which will determine the number of values (states) needed for the interpolation
 * 2. Determine the interpolation degree, which will determine the number of coefficients to calculate
 * 3. Assume N states are needed. Bucket N states and their associated epoch in a vector of size N.
 * 4. Set the start of the interpolation spline to the epoch of the first state.
 * 5. Normalize all state epochs between -1.0 and +1.0 (i.e. the first state's epoch is now -1.0 and the last is +1.0)
 * 6. Find the interpolation coefficients (ANISE will provide these algorithms).
 * 7. Optionally, verify that querying the interpolation at the initial epochs returns the original state data (x, y, z,... cov_vz_vz).

table UnequalTimeSteps {
   /*
    * A pre-sorted list of all of the offsets from the start_epoch of the Ephemeris
    * available in the list of coefficient data.
    * These time entries are centiseconds (10 milliseconds) past the start_epoch (defined
    * in the parent Ephemeris object). Perform a binary search in this index to retrieve
    * index for the desired epoch. Then, retrieve the StateCoefficients for that key.
    * Ensure that the desired epoch is within the usable start and end time offsets.
    * If the desired epoch is prior to that time, select the previous key and check again.
    * If the desired epoch is after that time, select the next key and check again.
    * If within usable time, call the appropriate interpolation function (using the parent's
    * interpolation_kind attribute) with each of the coefficients as the polynominal weights.
    *
    * NOTE: The index is a signed integer of 64 bits because floating point values do not
    * have the total order property, therefore we cannot guarantee an order thereby preventing
    * a binary search of said vector. Further, it's as a signed integer to trivially support trajectories
    * created with a forward and a backward propagation.
    *
    * NOTE: The index points to the start of the window. In theory, this should prevent the binary search
    * from having to seek to the previous set of data compared to a method where the index points to the middle of the window.
    *
    * NOTE: We store the data in centiseconds because experience has shown that, in some high fidelity scenarios,
    * a variable-duration spline may last less than one second (even for only 8 states). In practice, this leads to
    * a collision in the indexing if it were to be in seconds. Therefore, a LIMITATION of this structure is that
    * a variable-duration spline may only be up to 497 days long. If your trajectory is longer than that, you should
    * convert it to an equal-time-step trajectory.
